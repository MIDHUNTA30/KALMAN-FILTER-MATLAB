# KALMAN-FILTER-MATLAB
Kalman Filter using MATLAB.

The codes are based on my lecture note on Kalman filter titled A NOTE ON LINEAR QUADRATIC REGULATOR AND KALMAN FILTER. 
For a better understanding of the codes and the theory of Kalman filter, the note can be refered. The link for accessing the note is given below:
